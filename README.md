  This is a plugin that helps to create architecture decision records (ADR) within neovim. It provides
  a selection from templates and creates a new file in the *docs/* directory of your project. The
  plugin comes with a template heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/develop/template/adr-template.md">https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/develop/template/adr-template.md</a>.
</p>

## üöÄ Installation

Install the plugin with a plugin manager of your choice. Here are two examples:

**lazy.nvim**

```lua
{
  'dj95/adr-nvim',
  opts = {},
}
```

**Plug**

```lua
Plug 'dj95/adr-nvim'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After the installation you can configure the plugin by adding the following to your `init.lua`:

```lua
require('adr').setup({
    template_dir = "~/adr-templates",
})
```

If not `template_dir` is specified the default templates within this repository will be used.

Then create a keybinding, that calls `require('adr').create_from_template()`.

```lua
map("n", "<leader>na", require('adr').create_from_template())
```
